# SegmentedTrieSet<DELIMITER>

A `SegmentedTrieSet` is a specialized radix tree that organizes strings into a hierarchical structure where each node represents a complete segment rather than a single character. This approach is particularly useful for organizing delimited strings (such as file paths, domain names, or namespace hierarchies) efficiently.

## Features

* O(k) lookup, insertion, and deletion where k is the number of segments
* Automatic path compression through radix tree properties
* Support for prefix-based queries and traversals
* Memory-efficient storage of related strings
* Self referencing, means on insertion a unique identifier is returned, which can then be used to rebuild the inserted string

## Usage
```rust
use segmented_trie_string_set_flat::SegmentedTrieStringSetFlat;
let mut set = SegmentedTrieStringSetFlat::new("/");
let bin = set.insert("usr/local/bin");
let lib = set.insert("usr/local/lib");
assert!(set.contains("usr/local/bin"));
assert!(!set.contains("usr/bin"));
assert_eq!(set.find_by_id(bin).unwrap().key(), Some("usr/local/bin"));
assert_eq!(set.find_by_id(lib).unwrap().key(), Some("usr/local/lib"));
```

## Use Cases
Main use case is that many keys are inserted once, but lookup happens many times.
* Tree like storage structures such as file systems, or organizational hierarchies.

## Performance
The `SegmentedTrieSet` is optimized for scenarios where strings share common prefixes. By storing segments as nodes, it reduces redundancy and improves lookup times for related strings.

## Todo
* Implement more efficient storage for children nodes, possibly using a flat set
* Currently every branch of the tree gets its own node. This could be optimized by splitting nodes only when necessary. E.g. inserting "usr/local/bin" could create just 1 node instead of 3. If later "usr/local/lib" is inserted, the "local" node could be split into 2 children "bin" and "lib". OTOH it may not worth the overhead.
